## Read Me 
The vector Library inside "Core" was written by FranÃ§ois Lauze (francois@di.ku.dk), as well as the the files data_projectC.py and TestProjectC.py. 

The code for Advanced Extensions.py was written by me.

With the library written by Francois, I have implemented common Linear Algebra algorithms, such as Gramm Schmidt, Norm, Transposition, etc. 


## How to run
The language steeings are those of Python 3.6 or higher.  
This should run on Windows, Linux and macOS if Python is installed properly (using for instance Anaconda or Miniconda). 


* For Windows platforms, to execute your code, navigate to ProjectC folder and  
  C:\FolderPath> python TestProjectC.py
* For MacOS/Linux platforms, to execute your code, navigate to ProjectC folder and  
 folder_path$ python TestProjectC.py

#### Please note:
__Vector.py has been updated so that v @ w now computes the inner product of Vector v and Vector w (as with numpy).__
